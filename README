PHP Linux Scanner Server is a PHP web application that allows you to share multiple scanners (supported by SANE) over a network.

the following packages need to be installed:
* imagemagick (6.5.9+)  - For image conversion
* sane-utils            - For accessing scanners
* tesseract-ocr         - For image to text conversion
+ tesseract-ocr-eng     - English language file for tesseract
+ tesseract-ocr-deu     - German language file for tesseract
+ tesseract-ocr-deu-f   - German fraktur language file for tesseract
+ tesseract-ocr-fra     - French language file for tesseract
+ tesseract-ocr-ita     - Italian language file for tesseract
+ tesseract-ocr-nld     - Dutch language file for tesseract
+ tesseract-ocr-por     - Portuguese language file for tesseract
+ tesseract-ocr-spa     - Spanish language file for tesseract
+ tesseract-ocr-vie     - Vietnamese language file for tesseract
* apache2               - a web server
* php5                  - for running php
+ php5-curl             - for uploading scans to imgur.com
_ php5-cli              - for running php from command line
_ curl                  - for making url request via command line through the network (alternative to php5-cli)
+ tar                   - for downloading a copy of PHP Linux Scanner Server in .tar.bz2 format (link in footer)
+ zip                   - for downloading a compressed scan
+ php-fpdf              - for downloading a pdf file
+ libpaper-utils        - for detecting paper sizes
	* Mandatory
	+ Recommended for full functionality
	_ Optional

	Some of these will likely already be installed

	sudo apt-get install imagemagick sane-utils apache2 php5 php5-curl tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-* tar zip php-fpdf libpaper-utils

Permissions:
	The user www-data needs write permissions to the following folders (Depending on how you downloaded this you may need to create these directories)
		./scans
		./config
		./config/parallel

Security Notes:
	Anyone with access to the scanner can view all your scans
	Do not give www-data more permission than needed, there may be security holes

Supported Browsers:
	Firefox (recommended)
		http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all.html
	Google Chrome
		https://www.google.com/chrome
	Safari
		http://www.apple.com/safari/download/
	Opera
		http://www.opera.com/browser/
	IE 9+
		http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/downloads/ie-9/worldwide-languages
	IE 6-8 with google chrome crame installed

Enabling Auto-Deletion of old scans:
	cleaner.php: Old scan auto-deletion tool.
	http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=10294835&postcount=37

	Basically run this command
		crontab -e
	then add this line (if you need root here use sudo crontab -e)
		*/5 * * * * php -f /path/to/cleaner.php
	or this line (Will not require root unless yuo want it to work when you are not loged in)
		*/5 * * * * curl http://localhost/path/to/cleaner.php

	It will Check every 5 minutes for scans older than 1 hour (3600 seconds value
	in cleaner.php) and deletes them.

Frequently asked questions/issues:
	The brightness and contrast options do not work on lucid lynx.
		This is because lucid has ImageMagick 6.5.7-8 and the brightness-contrast option was added in version 6.5.9

	Why should I enable auto delete?
		So your Hard Drive does not end up full of scans
	Every time I load a page it is blank.
		Somehow there is a error somewhere check your apache error log for
			for me the file was located at
				/var/log/apache2/error.log
			You can set php to show the error in the browser by editing your php.ini
			for me it was located in 
				/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
			then find this line
				display_errors = Off
			and set it to On (it was on line 531 for me) 
			at this point apache will need a restart (sudo service apache2 restart)
	The conversion to text was very poor/blank
		Try making the image larger the text is probably too small for tesseract-ocr to read
	How can I change the amount of free disk space to warn at
		It is set on line 3 of index.php
	How can I change the time files are kept with auto-delete enabled
		Open cleaner.php and change the 3600 on line 7 to a different number (3600 is one hour in seconds)
	I see my scanner with the command "scanimage -L" but it is not being detected
		This is a permissions issue (and a royal pita)
			http://jhansonxi.blogspot.com/2010/10/scanner-access-enabler.html
		If the site goes out the script is included with this 1.2 lacks a desktop file
			scanner-access-enabler-1.1.tar.bz2 (http://www.mediafire.com/?86e6ykeueodu7tl)
			scanner-access-enabler-1.2.tar.bz2 (http://www.mediafire.com/?p1plimo2yf31kl3)
	Why can't I change the orientation on the scan page
		because the selected paper size will not fit in the scanner one way
	Why is the pdf download not working I keep getting a file with a error in it
		The script assumes fpdf.php is located in /usr/share/php/fpdf/ this is set on line 2 of download.php

Installation Notes:
	Extract files to /var/www (or where ever your web pages are visible from)
	Install the dependencies (you may use curl instead of php5-cli if you do not want auto delete you do not need either)
		sudo apt-get install tar apache2 php5 php5-cli imagemagick sane-utils tesseract-ocr
	Add www-data to the lp group
		sudo adduser www-data lp
	Restart service to apply the above command
		sudo service apache2 restart
	Be sure to update imagemagick on Lucid Lynx
	Make sure www-data can write files to the scans, config, and parallel folders
		sudo chown www-data /var/www/scans
		sudo chown -R www-data /var/www/config
	You may chmod them to 666 if you prefer

Apache Tricks:
	Enabling .htaccess
		open /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
		locate this:
			<Directory /var/www/>
				Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
				AllowOverride None
				Order allow,deny
				allow from all
			</Directory>
		you will see "AllowOverride None" change "None" to "All"
		make the change and save it
		now restart apache 
			sudo service apache2 restart

	Password protecting your scanner
		using .htaccess
			be sure .htaccess is enabled (see above)
			make a file called .htaccess in a folder visible over the network
			put this in it
				AuthName "Restricted Area" 
				AuthType Basic 
				AuthUserFile /var/www/.htpasswd 
				AuthGroupFile /dev/null
				require valid-user
			now me need to make a login (Bob is the user name)
				sudo htpasswd -c /var/www/.htpasswd Bob
			now you will have to login to access /var/www

		using /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
			open /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
			locate this:
				<Directory /var/www/>
					Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
					AllowOverride None
					Order allow,deny
					allow from all
				</Directory>
			make it look something like this:
				<Directory /var/www>
					Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
					AllowOverride None
					Order allow,deny
					allow from all
					AuthName "Please Login"
					AuthType Basic
					AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/users
					AuthGroupFile /dev/null
					require valid-user
				</Directory>
			now you need to make a login with this command
				sudo htpasswd -c /etc/apache2/users Bob
			now you need to restart apache
			        sudo service apache2 restart
			
	Setting a server name
		Open /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
		Add a new line at the top of the file
		add something like this
			ServerName www.scanner.com
		www.scanner.com and be anything you want
		now run this command
			sudo service apache2 restart
		now apache will not fuss about there not being a server name

	Running apache on a another port
		open /etc/apache2/ports.conf
		notice theses 2 lines
			NameVirtualHost *:80
			Listen 80
		thoes tell it to use port 80
		you can add more or change them
		for the sake of example we will use port 81 you may use any port number that is not in use (run a port scan to see what is in use)
		so we will add these to lines
			NameVirtualHost *:81
			Listen 81
		not we need to set a path to run on this port
		open /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
		go to the bottom of the file and add this 
			<VirtualHost *:81>
				DocumentRoot /foo/bar # /foo/bar could be /var/www or /home/bob/public_html for example
				<Directory /foo/bar>
					Options FollowSymLinks # follows symbolic links
					AllowOverride All # allows use of .htaccess
					Order allow,deny #allows everyone to access it via browser
					allow from all
				</Directory>
			</VirtualHost>
		now save and run this command
			sudo service apache2 restart
