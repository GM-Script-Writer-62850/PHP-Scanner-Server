PHP Linux Scanner Server is a PHP web application that allows you to share multiple scanners (supported by SANE) over a network.

The following packages need to be installed:
* imagemagick (6.5.9+)   - For image conversion
* sane-utils             - For accessing scanners
* usbutils               - For updating the device path for scanners using libusb
* tesseract-ocr          - For image to text conversion
* apache2                - a web server
* php5                   - For running php
* coreutils              - For various puropses, not having this would probally result in a unusable system
+ php5-curl              - For uploading scans to imgur.com
+ tar                    - For downloading a copy of PHP Linux Scanner Server in .tar.bz2 format (link in footer)

	Some of these will likely already be installed

	sudo apt-get install imagemagick sane-utils usbutils apache2 php5 php5-curl tesseract-ocr tar zip php-fpdf libpaper-utils grep sed coreutils

Permissions:
	The user www-data needs write permissions to the following folders
		./scans
		./config
		./config/parallel

Security Notes:
	Anyone with access to the scanner can view all your scans
	Do not give www-data more permission than needed, there may be security holes (If you find any let me know, they are bugs)

Supported Browsers:
	Firefox (recommended)
		http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all.html
	Google Chrome
		https://www.google.com/chrome
	Chromium
		http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel
	Safari
		http://www.apple.com/safari/download/
	Opera (NOT Opera Mini)
		http://www.opera.com/browser/
	IE 8+
		http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie-10-worldwide-languages
	IE 6-9 with Google Chrome Frame installed
		http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/ (EOL: January 2014)

Enabling Auto-Deletion of old scans:
	cleaner.php: Old scan auto-deletion tool.
		http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=10294835&postcount=37

	Basically run this command
		crontab -e
	then add this line (if you need root here use `sudo crontab -e`)
		*/5 * * * * php -f /path/to/cleaner.php
	or this line (Will not require root unless yuo want it to work when you are not loged in)
		*/5 * * * * curl http://localhost/path/to/cleaner.php

	It will Check every 5 minutes for scans older than 1 day (86400 seconds value
		in cleaner.php) and deletes them.

Frequently asked questions/issues:
	Some times when I download should be a large file I get nothing (a 0 byte file)
		You will need to increase the max memory PHP can use, 
			To do this run this command:
				cat /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini -n| grep memory_limit
			You will see something like this:
				407	memory_limit = 128M
			407 is the line number the setting is on
			We need to change the 128 to a higher number
			Open up /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini as root and change the number
			I am not sure how high you will need it, I have had issues with files under 60MB hitting the 128MB limit (total usage was under 45% of the limit)
			I set mine to 1024 (1 GiB) if you need more memory than you have ram be sure your swap partition is large enough to cover the overdraw
	Why don't you have a .deb .rpm etc file I an install
		This more like a addon than a program so I am note sure if one of thoes would be approate, I have written bash
		scripts to install and update this, if you look they are on the Downloads page in the Wiki
			https://github.com/GM-Script-Writer-62850/PHP-Scanner-Server/wiki/Downloads
	I am getting 404 errors for favicon.ico in my error log, how can I stop that
		sudo ln -s ../mods-available/rewrite.load /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/ && sudo service apache2 restart
	The brightness and contrast options do not work on lucid lynx.
		This is because lucid has ImageMagick 6.5.7-8 and the brightness-contrast option was added in version 6.5.9

	Why should I enable auto delete?
		So your Hard Drive does not end up full of scans
	What does EOL stand for 
		End Of Life, meaning it will no longer receive updates
	Every time I load a page it is blank.
		Somehow there is a error somewhere check your apache error log for
			for me the file was located at
				/var/log/apache2/error.log
			You can set php to show the error in the browser by editing your php.ini
			for me it was located in 
				/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
			then find this line
				display_errors = Off
			and set it to On (it was on line 531 for me) 
			at this point apache will need a restart (sudo service apache2 restart)
		If the error was not caused by you not reading the instructions please file a bug report
	The conversion to text was very poor/blank
		Try making the image larger the text is probably too small for tesseract-ocr to read
	How can I change the amount of free disk space to warn at
		It is set on line 3 of index.php
	How can I turn the auto update checker off
		It is set on line 6 of index.php
	How can I change the time files are kept with auto-delete enabled
		Open cleaner.php and change the 86400 on line 2 to a different number (86400 is one day in seconds)
			You can use math there and put 86400*7 to make it a week
	I see my scanner with the command "scanimage -L" but it is not being detected
		This is a permissions issue (and a royal pita)
			http://127.0.0.1/index.php?page=Access%20Enabler (link works after installing)
			http://jhansonxi.blogspot.com/2010/10/scanner-access-enabler.html
		If that site goes the access enabler is included with this (1.2 lacks a desktop file)
			scanner-access-enabler-1.1.tar.bz2 (http://www.mediafire.com/?86e6ykeueodu7tl)
			scanner-access-enabler-1.2.tar.bz2 (http://www.mediafire.com/?p1plimo2yf31kl3)
			scanner-access-enabler-1.4.tar.bz2 (http://www.mediafire.com/?4r1aw9ix9ayb0u0)
	Why can't I change the orientation on the scan page
		because the selected paper size will olny fit in the scanner one way
	Why is the pdf download (single page) not working I keep getting a file with a error in it
		The script assumes fpdf.php is located in /usr/share/php/fpdf/ this is set on line 2 of download.php

Installation Notes:
	Extract files to /var/www (or where ever your web pages are visible from)
	Install the dependencies (you may use curl instead of php5-cli if you do not want auto delete you do not need either)
		sudo apt-get install tar apache2 php5 php5-cli imagemagick sane-utils tesseract-ocr
	Add www-data to the lp group
		sudo adduser www-data lp
	Restart service to apply the above command
		sudo service apache2 restart
	Be sure to update imagemagick on Lucid Lynx (Ubuntu 10.04) and CentOS 
	Make sure www-data can write files to the scans, config, and parallel folders
		sudo chown www-data /var/www/scans
		sudo chown -R www-data /var/www/config
	You may chmod them to 666 if you prefer
	If you cloned the git repo you will need to create some folders, git does not allow empty folders
		sudo mkdir /var/www/scans
		sudo mkdir -p /var/www/config/parallel
	This command will give you your scanner's URL as a IP address (127.0.0.1 only works on the current system)
		ifconfig | sed -n 's/.*inet addr:\([0-9.]\+\)\s.*/http\:\/\/\1/p'
	This command will give you a easy to remember URL for the scanner (I remember this not working on Windows XP clients)
		echo http://$(uname -n).local/
	Be sure to check http://www.canyouseeme.org/ so you know if people can use your scanner on the Internet, I suggest using a firewall to prevent this, or putting a password on it.

Apache Tricks:
	Enabling .htaccess
		open /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
		locate this:
			<Directory /var/www/>
				Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
				AllowOverride None
				Order allow,deny
				allow from all
			</Directory>
		you will see "AllowOverride None" change "None" to "All"
		make the change and save it
		now restart apache 
			sudo service apache2 restart

	Password protecting your scanner
		using .htaccess
			be sure .htaccess is enabled (see above)
			make a file called .htaccess in a folder visible over the network
			put this in it
				AuthName "Restricted Area" 
				AuthType Basic 
				AuthUserFile /var/www/.htpasswd 
				AuthGroupFile /dev/null
				require valid-user
			now me need to make a login (Bob is the user name)
				sudo htpasswd -c /var/www/.htpasswd Bob
			now you will have to login to access /var/www

		using /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
			open /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
			locate this:
				<Directory /var/www/>
					Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
					AllowOverride None
					Order allow,deny
					allow from all
				</Directory>
			make it look something like this:
				<Directory /var/www>
					Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
					AllowOverride None
					Order allow,deny
					allow from all
					AuthName "Please Login"
					AuthType Basic
					AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/users
					AuthGroupFile /dev/null
					require valid-user
				</Directory>
			now you need to make a login with this command
				sudo htpasswd -c /etc/apache2/users Bob
			now you need to restart apache
			        sudo service apache2 restart
			
	Setting a server name
		Open /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
		Add a new line at the top of the file
		add something like this
			ServerName www.scanner.com
		www.scanner.com and be anything you want
		now run this command
			sudo service apache2 restart
		now apache will not fuss about there not being a server name

	Running apache on a another port
		open /etc/apache2/ports.conf
		notice theses 2 lines
			NameVirtualHost *:80
			Listen 80
		thoes tell it to use port 80
		you can add more or change them
		for the sake of example we will use port 81 you may use any port number that is not in use (run a port scan to see what is in use)
		so we will add these to lines
			NameVirtualHost *:81
			Listen 81
		not we need to set a path to run on this port
		open /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
		go to the bottom of the file and add this 
			<VirtualHost *:81>
				DocumentRoot /foo/bar # /foo/bar could be /var/www or /home/bob/public_html for example
				<Directory /foo/bar>
					Options FollowSymLinks # follows symbolic links
					AllowOverride All # allows use of .htaccess
					Order allow,deny #allows everyone to access it via browser
					allow from all
				</Directory>
			</VirtualHost>
		now save and run this command
			sudo service apache2 restart
